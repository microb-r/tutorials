# Create BioProject on NCBI

A BioProject is a collection of biological data related to a single initiative originating from a single organization or from a consortium.

[BioProject registration](https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/subs/bioproject/) is required as part of data deposit to several NCBI primary data archives including SRA, TSA and WGS. Typically, a BioProject is registered first or during the submission of a genome assembly being submitted to WGS. The BioProject is assigned a BioProject accession number (PRJNAxxxxxx) which is referenced when submitting the corresponding BioSamples and experimental data to archival databases. Use the same BioProject accession for related data, eg the raw reads that are submitted to SRA and a genome assembly of those reads that is submitted to GenBank/WGS. 

1. Click on **New Submission**
